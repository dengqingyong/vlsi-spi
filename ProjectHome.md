The Serial Peripheral Interface Bus or SPI bus is a synchronous serial data link standard that operates in full duplex mode. Devices communicate in master/slave mode where the master device initiates the data frame.
The advantages of the SPI are :
-Full duplex communication
-Complete protocol flexibility for the bits transferred
-Uses only four pins on packages, and wires in board layouts or connectors, much less than parallel interfaces
